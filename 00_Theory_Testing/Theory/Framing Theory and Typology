- defines framing as selecting some aspects of reality to AKE THEM MORE SALIENT
- four reasoning devices: 
  1) Problem definition

  In D’Angelo & Kuypers (Eds.), Doing News Framing Analysis.
- Frames consist of coherent packages of reasoning devices
- Evaluate frames by "Thickness", abstractness, applicability to other issues
- Examples of cultura frame types (methaphor, stereotype,...)

## Typology

As Eberl et al (2018) i would suggest applying both issue specific frames 
(relating directly to immigration as policy and social phenomenon) and generic 
frames (reflecting broader discussions in the news dicourse), as it can increase 
explanatory power. 
Issue-specific frames: particularily important in context of referendums (like
the 2014 initiative), as the debate revolves around concrete themes like labour markets, 
welfare systems or cultural identity. --> In the context of this initiative, prominent
themes included labour market dependency on foreign workers, pressure on infrastructure
and housing (due to increasing immigration) and the potential termination of bilateral
agreements with the EU.

Generic frames, such as blaming different actors (for example politicians or refugees/
immigrants themselves) or portraying debates as conflucts can also shape interpretation
regardless of a specific topic.
