## Framing Literature

1. Entman (1993)
  Entman, R. M. (1993). Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm. 
  Journal of Communication, 43(4), 51–58.
- defines framing as selecting some aspects of reality to AKE THEM MORE SALIENT
- four reasoning devices: 
  1) Problem definition
  2) Causal Interpretation
  3) Moral Evaluation
  4) Treatment Recommendation

- Frames consist of coherent packages of reasoning devices
- Evaluate frames by "Thickness", abstractness, applicability to other issues
- Examples of cultura frame types (methaphor, stereotype,...)

  Association, 42(3), 207–223.
- defines Issue-specific and generic frames for migration:

- five generic frames, still widely used:

## Typology

As Eberl et al (2018) i would suggest applying both issue specific frames 
(relating directly to immigration as policy and social phenomenon) and generic 
frames (reflecting broader discussions in the news dicourse), as it can increase 
explanatory power. 
Issue-specific frames: particularily important in context of referendums (like
the 2014 initiative), as the debate revolves around concrete themes like labour markets, 
welfare systems or cultural identity. --> In the context of this initiative, prominent
themes included labour market dependency on foreign workers, pressure on infrastructure
and housing (due to increasing immigration) and the potential termination of bilateral
agreements with the EU.
(https://www.sem.admin.ch/ejpd/de/home/themen/abstimmungen/2014-02-09.html)
Generic frames, such as blaming different actors (for example politicians or refugees/
immigrants themselves) or portraying debates as conflucts can also shape interpretation
regardless of a specific topic.


1. Economic Threat Frame (issue-specific)
------------------------------------------
Presents immigration as a burder/threat to national economic stability, welfare 
systems and labour markets. According to Eberl et al one of the most frequent issue-
specific frames in immigration discourse.

Reasoning devices: 
- Problem: Economic burden
- Cause: High inflow of migrants using resources
- Evaluation: System overload, unfair to "the Swiss"
- Solution: Restrict immigration, reduce benefits
---------------------------------------------------

2. Economic Benefit Frame (issue-specific) 
-----------------------------------------------------
Frames immigration as positive/necessary foreconomy, labor market or innovation. 
Highlights labor shrtages sectoral dependence of migration. 

Reasoning devices: 
- Problem: Labor shortages, risk of economic stagnation
- Cause: Demograohic trends, lack of available workes in country
- Evaluation: Immigration leads to economic growth, fills "gaps"
- Solution: Maintain access to foreign labor, uphold free movement agreements


3. Cultural Threat Frame (issue-specific)
---------------------------------------------------
Emphasizes the idea that immigration is a danger to national or cultural identity. 
Immigrants are portrayed as "others" who threaten traditional norms, values, 
and ways of life. According to Eberl et al., this frame is especially applied to 
Non-European migrants and is closely linked to fears of Islam, integration failure, 
and cultural erosion. In the Swiss case, themes of "overforeignization" (Überfremdung) 
are part of this narrative.

Reasoning devices: 
- Problem: Erosion of Swiss identity
- Cause: Immigration from culturally distant countries
- Evaluation: Incompatability
- Solution: Reinforce "national values" by restricting entry
------------------------------------------------------------

4. Security Frame (issue-specific)
------------------------------------------------------
Depicts migrants (especially asylum seekers/undocumented immigrants) as security
threats. Van Gorp describes this as the intruder frame, based on the stereotype
of migrants as criminals/infiltrators. Also overlaps with depictions of migrants
as accosiated with terrorism/organized crime.

Reasoning devices: 
- Problem: Increased crime or instability
- Cause: "weak" border control or failed asylum policy
- Evaluation: fear, disorder
- Solution: tighten borders, deport immigrants
-----------------------------------------------------------------

5. Humanitarian frame (issue-specific)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Portrays victims as vulnerable, fleeing percecution, war or poverty. Tends to
envoke empathy & humanitarian responsibility. 

Reasoning devices
- Problem: Human suffering
- Cause: Conflict, percecution, war
- Evaluation: Moral obligation to help
- Solution: offer asylum, humanitarian aid
----------------------------------------------------------------

6. Responsability/Blame Frame (generic)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Attributes the cause/solution of a problem to specific actors (government, EU, migrants)
Swiss case: blaming EU for immigration pressures or blaming migrants for integration
issues. 

Reasoning devices: 
--> depends on who is blamed? // Add later
-----------------------------------------------------------------

7. Moral Frame (generic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluates immigration through lens of morality, ethics, values. May invoke human
rights, religious beliefs, social mormas. 
--> either support of open policies (equality, compassion) or restriction (protection,
public order). 

Reasoning devices
--> depends, support or rejection // Add later
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Conflict Frame (generic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Emphasizes political or social confluct. Dominant frame used to dramatisized policy
debates. Often appears as clash between political parties, "natives" and "foreigners".

Reasoning devices
- Problem: Social or political disagreement
- Cause: Competing interests, ideologies
- Evaluation: Instability, polarization
- Solution: ? // Add later
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
